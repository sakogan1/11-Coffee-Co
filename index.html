        </h1>
        <p>HELLO!
            We are more than your normal 
            coffee shop; we are a part of your 
            everyday lives.  Our passion and 
            love of home-cooked meal is portrayed 
            in every dish we serve.
            Come and choose from our heartily 
            and healthy all day brunch, sexy 
            salads or good old fashioned 
            specials with a taste of Persia.  
            We have excellent coffee, speciality 
            teas and an array of freshly pressed 
            juices and smoothies.  And last but by far 
            not the least, we have freshly baked cakes 
            which will put a smile on your face.

    <div><h2>OUR STORY</h2>
<p>I started my first coffee shop in 2004 in 
    Hampstead Garden Suburbs after deciding to give 
    up my 9 to 5 job in the city. With no catering 
    experience, the only way I knew how to operate a
     business was NOT to look at it as a business. I 
     treated it like my home and all the customers were 
     guests in my home.
        After 13 years, I still stand by the same 
        principle as I have not yet 
        learnt the art of the business but 
        have mastered the art of being a host. 
        We buy the best fresh ingredients and cook 
        the food I serve to my family at home. 
        Everything is freshly cooked on site and 
        served immediately to our guests.</p>
